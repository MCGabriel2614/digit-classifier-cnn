# 🧠 Digit Classifier with CNN (MNIST)

A beginner-friendly convolutional neural network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Load and preprocess image data
- Build a CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers
- Train and evaluate a model with high accuracy
- Visualize training progress

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open this notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells to train the model
3. Evaluate performance on test data

## 🏁 Results

Achieved ~98% accuracy on MNIST test data after 5 epochs.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 98.3% |
| Loss     | 0.05  |
